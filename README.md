# Velocity Calculator and Fuel Management System

## Introduction
The project calculates the new velocity, distance, and remaining fuel based on the given parameters. The time is converted to hours for consistent unit usage. The new velocity is calculated based on the acceleration, and the new distance and remaining fuel are calculated based on the initial values and the elapsed time.

## Usage
Once the webpage is opened in your browser, you should see the message "Coming in hot!" displayed in the heading (<h1>) tag. Additionally, you can open the browser console to view the calculated results related to velocity, distance, and remaining fuel.

## Reflections
* During this project, I learned the importance of consistent unit usage and how it can impact the accuracy of calculations. I also had the opportunity to practice refactoring code to make it more readable and maintainable.
* One challenge I faced was ensuring that the time unit was consistent throughout the calculations. I overcame this challenge by converting the time to hours at the beginning of the script.

Overall, this project was a great exercise in debugging and refactoring code to make it more readable and maintainable. It also reinforced the importance of consistent unit usage in calculations.
